# Where to start
The most important files to look into is:
**Player**
```
res://src/Actors/Player.gd
```

**Animals**
```
res://src/Actors/
```

**Levels**
```
res://src/Levels/
```

**PlayerData**
```
res://src/Autoload/PlayerData.gd
res://src/Autoload/PlayerData.tscn
```

**User Interface**
```
res://src/UserInterface/
```


This will cover most of the code so you are able to understand the game. you can choose any animal and any level since they're all build up the same way and share the same values in their code
